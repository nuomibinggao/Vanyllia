## **A Refined Vanilla Experience**

Vanyllia enhances Minecraft’s core gameplay with subtle tweaks and quality-of-life improvements, staying true to Mojang’s original vision while polishing its rough edges. This pack retains vanilla’s charm but smooths out frustrations—think optimized performance, QoL tweaks, and enhanced visuals—all without overhauling what makes Minecraft timeless.

## **Key Features**:

**Quality-of-Life Tweaks**: Inventory sorting, all the MASA mods for technical players, and bug fixes for a seamless survival experience.

**Enhanced Visuals**: Shaders and resource packs makes the game look like you've never imagined, while keeping the vanilla feel.

**Optimized Performance**: Better FPS and chunk loading, even on older hardware.

**Vanilla-Compatible**: Play with friends on vanilla servers or clients—no extra setup required.

Perfect for purists who crave a _polished_ Minecraft, not a reinvented one.
